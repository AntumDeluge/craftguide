## Crafting Guide ##

#### A simple and fast Crafting Guide that doesn't suck for Minetest. ####

#### Usable with a book named *"Crafting Guide"*. ####

#### This crafting guide features two modes : Normal and Progressive. ####
The Progressive mode is a Terraria-like crafting guide system that only 
list the items in the crafting guide for which you already have the ingredients
in your inventory. The progressive mode is disabled by default and can be enabled with 
`craftguide_progressive_mode = true` in `minetest.conf`.

The formspec size is also easily configurable with this setting in `minetest.conf`:
`craftguide_size = WxH` (default: `8x3`). The minimum accepted size is `8x1`.
